    To where it bent in the undergrowth; \
    Then took the other, as just as fair, \
    And having perhaps the better claim, \
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear; \
    Though as for that the passing there \
    Had worn them really about the same, \
    And both that morning equally lay \
    In leaves no step had trodden black. \
    Oh, I kept the first for another day! \
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way, \
    I doubted if I should ever come back. \
    I shall be telling this with a sigh \
    Somewhere ages and ages hence: \
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” \
    I took the one less traveled by, \
    And that has made all the difference.";
